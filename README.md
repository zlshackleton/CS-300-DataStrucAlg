# CS-300-DataStrucAlg
<h2>#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?</h2>

Sorting algorithms to complete various tasks from clients like an AdvisorCourseList this allowed us to apply our knowledge of memory and dataruntime to choose the best data structure to apply to our project.

<h2>#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.</h2>

The runtime and search/insert of each datastructure matters based off of the information they are reading from a file or vector. This allowed me to determine which DS to use based off of the given course info document.

<h2>#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?</h2>

Learning new things in code is difficult if I dont know what I am looking at/using. Having tutors or online help from others allows me to gauge the level of coding I am using and crank it up or crank it down to a level I may understand better. Another solution to this would be to step away. Each break I took between each struggle I seemed to come back with a clearer mind and I was able to continue where I left off. 

<h2>#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?</h2>

Focusing on going over material I did not understand too well the first time helps re-develop my knowlege. Being able to use the information and build projects with it is the best way to learn! I think that this is a very important class and I will be taking this repository far with me into my future career.

<h2>#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</h2>

Other than the basics, each project I work on only gets more and more complex and I learn to adapt to that. consistency within code is key and I hope I can perform that to my fullest!
